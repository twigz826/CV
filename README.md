I am a junior software engineer and recent Makers Academy graduate. Having spent the majority of my career in financial services, I saw that many solutions to real world problems revolved around technology. I want to be at the forefront of building these solutions and this is what lead me to pivot my career towards software engineering.

I am now looking to join a team of like-minded individuals where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to improve and grow as a software engineer.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I thrive as part of a team after having grown up playing team sports through school and university. This gave me a strong foundation in understanding how teams succeed through meticulous planning, consistent training and an ethos of empowering individuals to understand their role and contribution to the bigger picture. In my career, I have always worked as part of project teams and have learnt the importance of clear communication combined with an enthusiastic attitude to drive positive behaviour. I relish the opportunity to learn from other members of the team while also giving actionable advice and support where possible. At Makers, I had the opportunity to work on a number of group projects, while at the same time adopting Agile work practices to efficiently coordinate the workload and deliver well functioning final products.

#### Adaptability

I have learnt how to adapt by embracing new challenges in my personal and professional life. I spent 6 months working in Chile as part of my university degree, and decided to move back in 2018 to fully immerse myself in a new culture while greatly improving my Spanish. I have also been able to adapt in my career by moving from a tax role to a financial advisory role, and have now taken this a step further by completing the Makers bootcamp and transitioning into software engineering. My experience thus far in computer programming has shown me that being able to adapt is an essential skill to have, and I am confident I will be able to continue to adapt to the various challenges that lie ahead.

#### Proactivity

Having recently been part of a very small team at Deloitte, I understand how important it is to be proactive to resolve issues as they arise and have always preferred to take the initiative rather than waiting for things to arrive at my feet. An example of this was in my last project at Deloitte prior to joining Makers. The decision was taken to use a project management tool that had been developed internally and recently released for use with clients. As the software was completely new to the whole team, I volunteered to be the software lead which involved completing all training sessions, configuring the software to the client's needs and leading client training workshops.

#### Leadership

I enjoy leading from the front to inspire others to go above and beyond expectations, and have consistently sought out opportunities in my career to lead by taking ownership of tasks. On a recent integration project at Deloitte, I lead the workstream for defining, projecting and tracking synergies throughout the first 100 days of the integration. Having little experience in this area, I took the time to learn as much as I could from senior colleagues and internal resources. I then coordinated key activities to be completed with the rest of the team through developing a roadmap and allocating tasks. I enjoyed building a strong team dynamic by reinforcing key principles like "honesty is the best policy", "there are no stupid questions" and "no person left behind".

#### Fast learner

From studying French and Spanish at university, to starting my career in corporate tax, to moving into a financial advisory role and finally learning to program, I have consistently taken on the challenge to learn new skills. I love expanding my knowledge in areas that interest me, and being at a relatively early stage in my software engineering career, the endless possibilities for learning new languages and technologies is something that greatly excites me. While I do not always understand every programming concept first time around, I believe everything can be understood once the right explanation or example is found, and I have learnt to embrace the feeling of uncertainty as a motivation to explore more deeply until I am satisfied that a particular concept makes sense. I hope to join a software engineering team that values learning as greatly as I do.

## Other achievements and interests

- I completed the National Pool Lifeguard Qualification, fulfilling the childhood dream of getting to climb up and sit on the big lifeguard chair (and trying very hard not to let the power go to my head).
- I am big into sport, with tennis and golf being my two favourites. I used to be quite good at the former (made it onto the Bristol University 1st team), and although I can't run down every ball like I once could, I still love it and try to play as much as I can. My current golf handicap is 7.
- My other miscellaneous interests include yoga, meditation, any outdoors activities, nutrition and trying to ferment anything and everything (a pandemic hobby turned obsession).
