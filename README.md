## Thomas Twigden

I am a junior software engineer and recent Makers Academy graduate. Having spent the majority of my career in financial services, I saw that many solutions to real world problems revolved around technology. I want to be at the forefront of building these solutions and this is what lead me to pivot my career towards software engineering.

I love challenging myself to solve complex problems while continuously learning and expanding my knowledge base. My prior commercial experience has taught me how to effectively manage projects, work in teams and deliver when faced with tight deadlines.

I am now looking to join a team of like-minded individuals where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to improve and grow as a software engineer.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I thrive as part of a team after having grown up playing team sports through school and university. This has given me a solid foundation in understanding the importance of team communication, helping everyone understand their role and how they contribute to the bigger picture and getting the best out of people. In my career, I have always worked on project teams and relish the opportunity to learn from more senior members while giving actionable advice and support to more junior members. At Makers, I had the opportunity to work on a number of project teams, while at the same time adopting Agile work practices to efficiently coordinate the workload and deliver well functioning final products.

#### Adaptability

I have learnt how to adapt to new situations in my professional and personal life through challenging myself to take on new opportunities. After spending part of my year abroad at university in Chile, I decided to move back in 2018 to immerse myself in a new culture and improve my Spanish. I have also been able to adapt in my career by moving from a tax role to a financial advisory role, and have now taken this a step further by completing the Makers bootcamp and transitioning into a software engineering role. My experience thus far in computer programming has shown me that being able to adapt is essential in this profession, and I am confident I will be able to continue to adapt to the various challenges that lie ahead.

#### Proactivity

Having recently been part of a very small team, I understand how important it is to be proactive to accomplish tasks and resolve issues. I have always preferred to take the initiative rather than waiting for things to arrive at my feet. An example of this was in my last project prior to joining Makers. The decision was taken to use a project management tool that had been developed internally and recently released for use with clients. As the software was completely new to the whole team, I volunteered to be the software lead which involved completing all training sessions, configuring the software to the client's needs, leading client training workshops and being the first port of call to answer any questions related to the tool and its features.

#### Leadership

I enjoy leading from the front and inspiring others to go above and beyond expectations in pursuit of the best possible outcome. In my career, I have consistently sought out opportunities to lead by taking ownership of a project and carrying it through to completion. While working on an integration project last year, I lead the workstream for defining, projecting and tracking synergies throughout the first 100 days of the integration. This was an area that I had never previously worked in, and I took the time to learn as much as I could from past projects, consult other professionals with relevant experience and then coordinate key activities to be completed with the rest of the team. I created an inclusive team dynamic by reinforcing the "no stupid questions" and "no person left behind" principles. I truly believe that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

#### Fast learner

From studying French and Spanish at university, to starting my career in corporate tax, to moving into a financial advisory role and finally learning to program, I have consistently taken on the challenge to learn new skills. I love expanding my knowledge in areas that interest me, and being at a relatively early stage in my software engineering career, the endless possibilities for learning new languages and technologies is something that greatly excites me. While I do not necessarily understand every programming concept first time around, I believe everything can be understood once the right explanation or example is found, and I have learnt to embrace the feeling of uncertainty as a motivation to explore more deeply until I am satisfied that a particular concept makes sense. I hope to join a company that values learning as greatly as I do.
