## Thomas Twigden

I am a junior software engineer and recent Makers graduate. I love challenging myself to solve complex problems and have quickly learnt that there are plenty of those in the programming world.

Having spent the majority of my career in financial advisory, I saw that many solutions to real world problems revolved around technology. I want to be at the forefront of building these solutions and this is what lead me to pivot my career towards software engineering.

I am now looking to join a team of like-minded individuals where I can learn and contribute to something that genuinely excites me.
