Throughout my career as a financial consultant, I would often face problems and inefficiencies that I believed could be solved using technology. This curiosity lead me to delve deeper into programming, where I was quickly hooked on the challenge of complex problem-solving coupled with the endless possibilities of learning new languages, frameworks and techniques.

Being at the forefront of building software solutions, with the potential to modernise many different industries, is something that greatly motivates me and has lead me to pivot my career towards software engineering.

My professional experience in financial advisory has taught me how to work in teams, be proactive and adapt to new challenges. After having recently graduated from a three-month intensive bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech), I am now looking to begin a new phase of my career by joining a team of software engineers.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I thrive as part of a team after having grown up playing team sports through school and university. This gave me a strong foundation in understanding how teams succeed through meticulous planning, consistent training and an ethos of empowering individuals to understand their contribution to the bigger picture. In my career, I have always worked as part of project teams and have learnt the importance of clear communication combined with an enthusiastic attitude to drive positive behaviour. I relish the opportunity to learn from other members of the team while also giving actionable advice and support where possible. At Makers, I worked on three distinct group projects using agile principles, such as stand-ups and retros, to efficiently coordinate the workload and deliver well functioning final products.

#### Adaptability

I have learnt how to adapt by embracing new challenges in my personal and professional life. I spent 6 months working in Chile as part of my university degree, and decided to move back in 2018 to fully immerse myself in a new culture while greatly improving my Spanish. I have also been able to adapt in my career by moving from a tax role to a financial advisory role, and have now taken this a step further by completing the Makers bootcamp and transitioning into software engineering. My experience thus far in programming has shown me that being able to adapt is an essential skill to have given the speed at which technologies continue to evolve and change. As part of my final project at Makers, I was able to learn a completely new framework and use it to build a mobile application in less than two weeks.

#### Proactivity

Having recently been part of a very small team at Deloitte, I understand how important it is to be proactive to resolve issues as they arise and have always preferred to take the initiative rather than waiting for things to arrive at my feet. An example of this was in my last project at Deloitte prior to joining Makers. The decision was taken to use a project management tool that had been developed internally and recently released for use with clients. As the software was completely new to the whole team, I volunteered to be the software lead which involved completing all training sessions, configuring the software to the client's needs and leading client training workshops.

#### Self-led learner

From studying French and Spanish at university, to starting my career in corporate tax, to moving into a financial advisory role and finally learning to program, I have consistently taken on the challenge to learn new skills. I love expanding my knowledge in areas that interest me, and being at a relatively early stage in my software engineering career, the possibilities for learning new languages and technologies is something that greatly excites me. While I do not always understand every programming concept first time around, I believe everything can be understood once the right explanation or example is found, and I have learnt to embrace the feeling of uncertainty as a motivation to explore more deeply until I am satisfied that a particular concept makes sense.

## Other achievements and interests

- I completed the National Pool Lifeguard Qualification, fulfilling the childhood dream of getting to climb up and sit on the big lifeguard chair (and trying very hard not to let the power go to my head).
- I play a lot of sport, with tennis and golf being my two favourites. I used to be quite good at the former (made it onto the Bristol University 1st team), and although I can't run down every ball like I once could, I still love it and try to play as much as I can. My current golf handicap is 7.
- My other miscellaneous interests include yoga, meditation, any outdoors activities, nutrition and trying to ferment anything and everything (a pandemic hobby turned obsession).
